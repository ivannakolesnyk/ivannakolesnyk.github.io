## SPECIFIC TECHNICAL DECISIONS

(This comes at a later stage when you start implementing the site)

### Colors

Generate color shades/tints (See video 2.2.3 Colors)

### Typography

a. Choose a font for titles (You will probably want to change it when you see the site, but
start with something)
b. If body text needs another font, choose it. Preferably, use the same font for all texts.
c. Define font scale using https://type-scale.com/

### Hierarchy and layout:

a. Which elements will need an accent because we want to increase their priority in the
hierarchy?
b. What components will we need to implement the necessary layouts?

### Icons:

a. Choose icon pack if you need one. See http://codingheroes.io/resources/#icons

### Spacing:

a. Define spacing scale, f.ex, multiples of 16px (multiples of 4px for smaller padding)

### Border rounding:

a. Synchronize the chosen font with roundedness (very rounded font → more border
rounding for elements)
b. Border rounding amount for general elements: cards, forms, images, etc
c. Border rounding for buttons
